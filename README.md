Conecta is a library designed to load data from SQL databases into arrow with maximum 
speed and memory efficiency by leveraging zero-copy and true concurrency in Python.


```python
from conecta import read_sql

table = read_sql(
    "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/postgres",
    query="select * from lineitem",
    partition_number=4
)
```

This snippet will create a pool, launch 4 threads, send four different queries and
stream the results to arrow. The core is written in Rust.

Conecta integrates natively to the arrow ecosystem, we support
several arrow libraries: [pyarrow](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/),
[arro3](https://pypi.org/project/arro3-core/) and [nanoarrow](https://pypi.org/project/nanoarrow/).
Additionally, you can create dataframes like Polars or Pandas.

```python
from conecta import read_sql
import polars as pl
import pandas as pd

table = read_sql(
    "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/postgres",
    query="select * from lineitem",
    partition_number=4,
    
    # By default pyarrow is the arrow backend.
    results_backend='pyarrow'
)

# -- Polars --
# You could use results_backend='arro3' for a smaller
# installation setup.
df = pl.from_arrow(table)

# -- Pandas --
df = table.to_pandas()
```

## How to install.
You can install it with `todo`

## When should you use `conecta`.
